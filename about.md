Hi!  I'm Brian Kroth.

This is my simple Github Pages site I'm using to host little blog articles on technie related things and whatnot.

## Work

I'm a Prinicple Research Software Development Engineer (RSDE) at Microsoft's [Gray Systems Lab](https://aka.ms/gsl), an applied research group inside [Azure Data](https://azure.microsoft.com/) where I.

I'm based in [Madison, WI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin) where I work with and mentor a collection of professors and students from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu).

Prior to that I was a [Systems Administrator](https://cae.wisc.edu/~bpkroth) at the [College of Engineering](https://engr.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison, where I was also a [student](https://cs.wisc.edu/~bpkroth) in the department of [Computer Sciences](https://cs.wisc.edu).
I also worked on the setting up the [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us) testbed site there.

### Interests

I've long been primarily a Linux person, but am a bit of a jack of all trades after more than two decades in industry.

I'm interested in a variety of things, including:

- Systems
- Networking
- Virtualization
- Storage
- Power
- Performance
- Benchmarking

I've dabbled in a variety of these areas with a touch of "ML for Systems" in the last number of years.
But in general, I like going deep, measure first, and using those insights to make things more stable, effecient, fast, etc.

I am one of the original developers and maintainers of the [MLOS](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS) project and also help maintain [benchbase](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase).
Together we use these to provide benchmarking and autotuning as a service within Azure Data.
